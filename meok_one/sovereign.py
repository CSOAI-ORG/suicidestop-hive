"""
MEOK ONE — SOVEREIGN: the BFT-of-MoEs council. 12 experts around 1 orchestrator.

Sovereign is NOT one LLM. It is a Byzantine-Fault-Tolerant council of Mixture-of-
Experts. The user talks to ONE thing — their character — but behind the face:

    1  COMPANION node  drafts the warm, in-character reply (the voice heard).
    11 EXPERT-LENS nodes each REVIEW that draft through a specialist viewpoint
       (security, compliance, care, contrarian, ...), EACH running a REAL model.
    1  SOVEREIGN orchestrator reconciles: safety lenses may VETO; the rest VOTE;
       the Sovereign synthesises ONE reply.

  -> 12 council nodes around 1 Sovereign ("12 around 1"). 12 voters tolerate
     f=3 Byzantine faults (12 >= 3f+1): a minority of bad/hallucinating/compromised
     nodes cannot force an unsafe or low-care answer, because SAFETY IS A VETO and
     quality is a vote over the SAFE set.

This MARRIES two pre-existing assets that were never wired together:
    * meok/core/expert_profiles.py — the 11 real expert lenses (IMPORTED, not re-made).
      That PBFT-MoE infra voted SYNTHETICALLY (familiarity weights + rules, zero model
      calls). Here the same lenses get REAL model opinions — the missing marriage.
    * meok_one/router.py — real model calls (local VM Ollama + cloud Gemini), and
      meok_one/connect.py — the persona+memory+safety wrapper.

Honest by construction: every node's verdict comes from a real model reply (or is
recorded as 'unavailable'); the Sovereign never fabricates consensus. If no model
answers, it says so.
