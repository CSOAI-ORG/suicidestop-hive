portability.py — the Free→Local seam.

"True ownership" isn't an NFT — it's the right to walk away with everything and self-host it.
This builds a single, tamper-evident export bundle (GDPR Art 20 portability) that a hosted MEOK
user can download and import into the OSS local build with `import_bundle.py`. Stdlib only.

Bundle = your characters (roster) + per-character vitals (bond/stage) + your memory + a SIGIL-
signed sha256 attestation so the local side can prove the bundle wasn't tampered with in transit.
