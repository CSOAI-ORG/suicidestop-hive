MEOK ONE — TUNNELS: wire all 3 tool worlds into the one safe gateway.

Nick: "MCP tunnels to all" (steps 1, 2, 3). This is the single entry point that connects:
  1. SOV3 inner tools        (live on the VM)            — auto-seeded by tool_gateway
  2. Published MEOK MCPs      (~316 PyPI packages)        — via published_bridge
  3. Session/business MCPs    (Stripe/Gmail/Vercel/...)   — registered read-or-confirm here

Everything routes through tool_gateway's 3-tier safety policy (read=auto, write=confirm,
prohibited=never). A character — even on a tiny local model — gets ONE safe surface to all
tools, and physically cannot fire a money/credential/delete tool on its own.

    open_all_tunnels()  -> connect all 3 worlds, return the unified catalog + counts
    safe_call(tool, args, confirm=None) -> the one call a character uses (read-only default)
